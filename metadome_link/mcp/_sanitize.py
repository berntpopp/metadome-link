"""Error-message sanitation for caller-visible strings (defense in depth).

MetaDome is a *classify* backend (no ``untrusted_content`` prose fence), so this
module carries the minimal, fleet-standard code-point set + a ``sanitize_message``
helper used by the MCP error boundary. It is applied to EVERY caller-visible
error/message/diagnostics string so a hostile upstream body (or a caller-influenced
4xx/5xx response) can never smuggle control, zero-width, bidirectional, or NUL code
points into an error frame that reaches the model in either ``structured_content``
or the ``TextContent`` JSON mirror.

This is a backstop for **server-authored** strings only: it strips code points but
NOT injection prose. Attacker-influenceable upstream response bodies are additionally
kept out of caller-visible messages at their source (the API client severs them into
fixed, status-keyed messages -- see ``metadome_link/api/client.py``).
