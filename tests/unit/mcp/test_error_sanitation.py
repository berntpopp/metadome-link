"""Unit contract for ``sanitize_message`` (error-message code-point fence).

Proves the primitive strips the ratified control/zero-width/bidi/NUL code points,
preserves ordinary prose, and length-caps at the fleet norm (280). The wiring of
this primitive onto the real MCP error surfaces is covered by
``test_error_leak_fencing.py``.
